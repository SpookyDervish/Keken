# Word Modifiers
Keken is kind of like Latin, because you have prefixes and suffixes and stuff…
With word modifiers (prefixes or suffixes), some of them use diacritical marks to determine different versions of the same prefix / suffix. (age being an example). These diacritical marks change the pitch of the final vowel. `(I hope I'm making a tonal language correctly... 😭)`

### Some Info about Prefixes and Suffixes

#### Quick spelling rule:
if a word ends in the same letter that a suffix starts with, the last letter of the word is removed. And a similar rule for prefixes, if the word starts with the same letter the prefix ends with, the first letter of the word is removed. In both cases the prefix/suffix is not modified. This is to prevent double letters which look ugly.

#### Info about "ke" and "de"

Ke and de can replace the adjective that would normally came before or after a word, and it also allows you to add suffixes like sa, za, la, ma or zut which normally apply to adjectives.

#### Mixing the Adjective Modifiers

Adjective intensity modifiers and their “more” counterpart can be combined. For example, “sá” just makes an adjective more intense (like writing “very” in english), and you can combine sá and sâ to mean “far more” or “much more”, and vice versa. You can also combine the “sà” suffix (the suffix for “somewhat”) and the “sâ” suffix (the suffix for “more”), which would translate to “somewhat more”, and vice versa.

#### When to use gender suffixes

Gender suffixes are used for specific words that apply to people, I’m not entirely sure how to word this in a way that makes sense, but here are some english nouns that would have gender suffixes in Keken:

- Person  
- Baby  
- Teen  
- Child
