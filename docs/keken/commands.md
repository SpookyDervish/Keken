# Commands
Use the word "ze" between the subject and the verb to indicate something is a command. In certain. cases, you can drop the subject entirely if it’s obvious.  
**For example:**. 
“tam ze stųpţa!” (this means “Stop!”)  
this works, but the “tam” (you prefix) is not needed. The sentence can just become:  
“ze stųp!”
