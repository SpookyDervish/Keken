# Adverbs
All adverbs are based on adjectives. Just give an adjective the “ē” ending.
**Note:** if an adjective ends with a vowel, then add the “tē” ending instead.
**Here’s an example:**
“zoo” - fast
“zootē” - quickly
“s̄ais” - soft
“s̄aisē” - softly
Some adverbs have specific meanings, for instance, the adverb form of “miţa” (which means respectfully) translates to “please”.
