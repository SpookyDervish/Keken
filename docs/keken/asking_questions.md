# Asking Questions
To ask a question in Keken, it’s very similar to German (if not the same). You swap the subject and  
the verb.  
**Here’s an example:**  
“Tamtakţa kimö” - You are happy.  
“Taktamţa kimö” - Are you happy? (we swapped the prefix for you and the word “to be”)    
The thing is, Keken has no question words like “what” or “why”, they are implied by context.
