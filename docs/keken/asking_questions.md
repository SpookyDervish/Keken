# Asking Questions
To ask a question in Keken, it’s very similar to German (if not the same). You swap the subject and  
the verb.  
**Here’s an example:**  
“tamtakţa kimö” - You are happy.  
“o taktamţa kimö” - Are you happy? (we swapped the prefix for you and the word “to be”)    

A question particle is also required to tell the difference between each type of question, you add question particles before the verb in the sentence.
| Particle | Meaning |
|---|---|
| o | Are |
| os | Were |
| ok | Will |
| ol | Do |
| ols | Did |
| le | How |
| la | Who |
| em | Where |
| vai | What |
| vel | When |
